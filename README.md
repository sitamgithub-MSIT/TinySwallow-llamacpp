# TinySwallow Llama.cpp

TinySwallow-1.5B-Instruct, a Japanese instruction-tuned language model, leverages TAID knowledge distillation from Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, improving instruction following and conversational abilities.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `app.py`: The file containing the main gradio application.
- `logger.py`: The file containing the code for logging the application.
- `exception.py`: The file containing the code for custom exceptions used in the project.
- `requirements.txt`: The file containing the list of dependencies for the project.
- `LICENSE`: The license file for the project.
- `README.md`: The README file that contains information about the project.
- `assets`: The folder containing screenshots for working on the application.
- `.gitignore`: The file containing the list of files and directories to be ignored by Git.

## Tech Stack

- Python (for the programming language)
- Llama.cpp (llama-cpp-python as Python binding for llama.cpp)
- Hugging Face Hub (for the GGUF model)
- Gradio (for the main application)
